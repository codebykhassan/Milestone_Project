# Milestone Project - C++ Program

## Overview

This milestone project in C++ focuses on creating a program with key features such as handling data errors, integrating external data sources (like Paris data), and implementing AI prompt tracking. The program is organized in multiple files to maintain modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- **Data Handling**: The program can process various types of data, handling errors and unexpected inputs.
- **Paris Data Integration**: The project demonstrates how to integrate external data into the system.
- **AI Prompt Tracking**: Tracks inputs and outputs through the AI system for later analysis.
- **Modular Design**: The project is broken down into multiple source and header files, with clear separation of concerns.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++ or clang++)
- Any external libraries or dependencies will be listed here (if applicable).
